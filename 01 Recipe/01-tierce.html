		A member of the same family as cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts, kale stars in this soup, which is garnished with Greek yogurt, and served with crumbled kale chips. <em>(Special thanks to Ingrid Lysgaard and <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/" target="_new">The Boston Globe</a> for this excellent recipe!)</em></p>

		<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>olive oil (for sprinkling)</li>
			<li>2 lbs. kale, stemmed</li>
			<li>salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
			<li>6 cups vegetarian "no-chicken" broth (try <a href="http://www.imaginefoods.com/products/broths-stocks/organic-no-chicken-broth" target="_new">Imagine's No-Chicken Broth</a>, or <a href="http://www.betterthanbouillon.com/products/product-detail.aspx?productid=24" target="_new">Swanson's "Better Than Bouillon"</a>)</li>
			<li>4 slices veggie bacon, cut into small strips (we recommend <a href="http://www.sweetearthfoods.com/">Sweet Earth Naturals'</a> Benevolent Bacon)</li>
			<li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
			<li>&frac14; tsp. crushed red pepper (or more, to taste)</li>
			<li>3 medium carrots</li>
			<li>2 whole cloves</li>
			<li>1 bay leaf</li>
			<li>&frac12; cup Greek yogurt</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>PREPARATION</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Set the oven to 300 degrees. Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
			<li>Cut the kale into large pieces and wash them thoroughly. Take 20 of the larger ones and spin them in a salad spinner or dry them thoroughly with paper towels. Place them on the baking sheet. Toast in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until dry and crisp. Check them after 8 minutes to see if they are browning too fast. When they're done, remove them from the oven and sprinkle with salt.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, in a soup pot, combine the remaining leaves with 1 cup of the "no-chicken" stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
			<li>In a skillet, render the veggie bacon for 5 minutes, turning often, or until golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Set aside to tbsp. for garnish. Add the remaining bacon to the kale.</li>
			<li>Add the onion, garlic, salt, black pepper, and red pepper to the skillet, with additional oil if needed. Cook, stirring often, for 8 minutes. Add it to the kale mixture with the remaining 5 cups "no-chicken" stock, carrots, cloves, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and cover the pot. Simmer for 40 minutes or until all the vegetables are tender. Remove the bay leaf and cloves (if you can find them).</li>
			<li>Working in batches, puree the soup until smooth. Return to the pot. Taste the soup for seasoning and add more salt and red pepper, if you like. Ladle into bowls and garnish with yogurt and reserved veggie bacon. Serve with kale chips and enjoy!</li>
